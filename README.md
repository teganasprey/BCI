# __BCI Research__

This repo contains all materials necessary to analyze a set of data collected as part of a study on motor imagery BCI. The data can be downloaded from: [BCI Data](https://figshare.com/collections/A_large_electroencephalographic_motor_imagery_dataset_for_electroencephalographic_brain_computer_interfaces/3917698),

Teh repo is organized as follows:

## Data
This directory contains an explanation of the data format. The data files were too large to include directly in the repo.

## Preprocessing
Preprocessing of the EEG data is an important step toward the efficient extraction of salient features. Several preprocessing methods are included in the repo, and include the following:

### CSP


### PCA

### ICA

### FFT

### DWT

### Digital Filtering

## Models
Several modelling techniques are included in the repo. These include methods for classification of feature and signals, including the following:

### ELM

### KNN

### LDA

### Naive Bayes

### SVM

In addition to classification algorithms, the repo also includes several implementations of neural network models, including the following:

### CNN

### DNN

### LSTM
 

## Papers
When possible, we include the supporting academic papers or books for the methods and algorithms contained in the repo.
